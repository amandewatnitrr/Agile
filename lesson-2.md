# KANBAN

![](https://github.com/amandewatnitrr/Agile/blob/master/img/What-is-Kanban.png)

- Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development.
- It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work.
- Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

- Agile software development teams today are able to leverage these same JIT principles by matching the amount of work in progress (WIP) to the team's capacity. 
- This gives teams more flexible planning options, faster output, clearer focus, and transparency throughout the development cycle.

- The Kanban method is a management method for ..
  - directly improving service delivery
  - Catalyzing improvements
  - Evolving a business to be "fit for purpose"

- Service Delivery Principles in the Kanban method:
  - Understand and focus on your customer's needs and expectations
  - Manage the work, let people self-organize around it.
  - Your Organization is an ecosystem of independent services steered by it's policies, reflect regularly on their effective and improve them

- While the core principles of the framework are timeless and applicable to almost any industry, software development teams have found particular success with the agile practice. 
- In part, this is because software teams can begin practicing with little to no overhead once they understand the basic principles. 
- Unlike implementing kanban on a factory floor, which would involve changes to physical processes and the addition of substantial materials, the only physical things software teams need are a board and cards, and even those can be virtual.

- Learn to view what you do now as a set of services(that can be improved):
  - Service Orientation Paradigm
    - Creative & Knowledge work is service-oriented.
    - Services have a requestor who both requests a product or service and accepts or acknowledges delivery of the finished item.
    - Service Delivery may involve workflow
    - Workflow involves a series of Knowledge discovery activities
    - The way in which a service is treated defines it's class of service.
