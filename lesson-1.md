- Agile is not a methodology, it isn't a specific way of doing software development, it isn't a framework or a process.
- Agile is a set of values and principles.
- It is a mindset, a way of thinking about software development. It is a way of thinking about how to get the best results from your team.
- Most of the discussion about agile is about the practices that are used to implement the values and principles and methodologies.
- For example, A team may find that having a daily standup is helpful, the standup is only agile to the extent that it is the result of a team following the agile principles and values.
- When you understand this, it is easy to see that agile is really a collection of beliefs, that teams can use for making decisions about how to do work of developing software.

- While this means the term Agile gets subjected to a great deal of abuse when people claim that this or that is the way to be agile.
- It also means that if you truly understand is, it's surprisingly flexible.
- Agile doesn't make decisions for you. instead it gives you a foundation for teams to make decisions about how to do their work and how to make decision that result in better software development.
- The Agile Manifesto has only 68 words and it simply says that we can develop software better by valuing the items on the left side of the list more than the items on the right side of the list.
