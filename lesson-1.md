# Agile Methodology

![](https://github.com/amandewatnitrr/Agile/blob/master/img/Introduction-to-Agile.png)

- Agile is not a methodology, it isn't a specific way of doing software development, it isn't a framework or a process.
- Agile is a set of values and principles.
- It is a mindset, a way of thinking about software development. It is a way of thinking about how to get the best results from your team.
- Most of the discussion about agile is about the practices that are used to implement the values and principles and methodologies.
- For example, A team may find that having a daily standup is helpful, the standup is only agile to the extent that it is the result of a team following the agile principles and values.
- When you understand this, it is easy to see that agile is really a collection of beliefs, that teams can use for making decisions about how to do work of developing software.

- While this means the term Agile gets subjected to a great deal of abuse when people claim that this or that is the way to be agile.
- It also means that if you truly understand is, it's surprisingly flexible.
- Agile doesn't make decisions for you. instead it gives you a foundation for teams to make decisions about how to do their work and how to make decision that result in better software development.
- The Agile Manifesto has only 68 words and it simply says that we can develop software better by valuing the items on the left side of the list more than the items on the right side of the list.

- While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
- In addition, to the values of the manifesto there are 12 principles that support the values. These principles are more about giving you the ability to make a good decision.
- The 12 Principles are:
  - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
  - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
  - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
  - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
  - Build Projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
  - The Most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
  - Working Software is the primary measure of progress.
  - Agile Processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
  - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
  - Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
  - The Best Architecture, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
  - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

- Agile's real utility is is giving people a common foundation for making decisions about the best way to develop software.
- Being Agile means making each decision based on the principles and values that the team has decided to follow.
- The Decision making process matter, you can't try to short circuit things by taking decisions made by another team and just blindly doing what they decided to do.
- Another teams may make decisions based on the agile principles and values that end up with a particular way of doing their work.
- Simply trying to mimic another team's actions and practices won't make your team agile.
- The things that are easy to notice in a highly agile team are the practices they are using. But the practices a team uses us the result of following agile principles and values.
- It is less important what practices a team happens to be using than why they are using it.
- In fact, as time goes by a good agile team is probably going to change and refine the practices they use.
- A team might start with SCRUM and later find that KANBAN is a better fit for delivering value to their customers.
- The Decision Making Process is how a team becomes Agile.
