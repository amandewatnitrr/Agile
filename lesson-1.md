# Agile Mehtodology

- Agile is not a methodology, it isn't a specific way of doing software development, it isn't a framework or a process.
- Agile is a set of values and principles.
- It is a mindset, a way of thinking about software development. It is a way of thinking about how to get the best results from your team.
- Most of the discussion about agile is about the practices that are used to implement the values and principles and methodologies.
- For example, A team may find that having a daily standup is helpful, the standup is only agile to the extent that it is the result of a team following the agile principles and values.
